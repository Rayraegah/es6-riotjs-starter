# es6-riotjs-starter
A damn simple riotjs starter kit webpack v2 tooling that I use.

## Dependencies
Babel, Riotjs, Webpack, Cross environment, and Shell cli tools.

## Getting started
Clone this repo and run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` for development server or `npm run build` to make a production build.
